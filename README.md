A 40 Key macro keyboard running off an ESP32, using IRC messages to 
trigger commands in Kruiz Control and automate OBS Studio scenes etc.
LCD Screen shows the current button / Scene in play
Oh, and it's wireless

Using https://github.com/fredimachado/ArduinoIRC
Kruiz Control https://github.com/Kruiser8/Kruiz-Control

Complete the fields in ExampleCreds.h, save and rename to Creds.h

The 3D files.

I printed mine in sections and glued them together to save on support material.

I have included the files to print in this way however I have also provided the option to print the base as one part.


Once printed I used a torch to heat up and insert 3mm hex nuts into the lid columns. Be careful here, there is not alot of material around the end.

I have also included BlankButtonMaster.3mf which should allow you to make most letter combinations for custom blank keys. 
If there is button label you are unable to make with this let me know and I should be able to update the file for future users.
